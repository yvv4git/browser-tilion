# status_code

Loads a list of URLs in the Tilion container and prints the HTTP status code
of each main document response. The example demonstrates request interception
with `HijackRequests`:

- the `*` route matches document requests
- the request is continued and the response is loaded with `LoadResponse`
- the status code is read from the response payload

## Usage

The container must be running first:

```bash
cd .. && make up
```

Run the example:

```bash
go run ./status_code -addr http://localhost:9222
```
